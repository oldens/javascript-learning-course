## 1. Introduction to JavaScript

JavaScript is a versatile and powerful programming language that is widely used for web development. It was created by Brendan Eich in 1995 and has since become one of the most popular programming languages in the world. JavaScript is primarily used to create interactive and dynamic web pages, but it can also be used for server-side development, mobile app development, and more.

## 2. JavaScript Syntax

JavaScript syntax refers to the set of rules that define how a JavaScript program is written and interpreted. Here are some key points about JavaScript syntax:

- JavaScript is case-sensitive, meaning that `myVariable` and `myvariable` are considered different variables.
- Statements in JavaScript are usually terminated with a semicolon (`;`).
- JavaScript code can be written within `<script>` tags in an HTML file or in external `.js` files.

## 3. Variables and Data Types

Variables are used to store data in a JavaScript program. To declare a variable, you can use the `var`, `let`, or `const` keywords. Here are some examples:

```javascript
var myVariable = 10;
let myOtherVariable = "Hello, world!";
const myConstant = 3.14;
```

JavaScript has several data types, including:

- `Number`: Represents numeric values, e.g., `10`, `3.14`.
- `String`: Represents text, e.g., `"Hello, world!"`.
- `Boolean`: Represents true or false values, e.g., `true`, `false`.
- `Array`: Represents a collection of values, e.g., `[1, 2, 3]`.
- `Object`: Represents a collection of key-value pairs, e.g., `{ name: "John", age: 30 }`.

## 4. Operators

Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values. Here are some common operators in JavaScript:

- Arithmetic operators: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`
- Comparison operators: `==`, `===`, `!=`, `!==`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`
- Logical operators: `&&`, `||`, `!`

## 5. Control Structures

Control structures are used to control the flow of a program. Here are some common control structures in JavaScript:

- `if` statement: Used to execute a block of code if a condition is true.
- `else` statement: Used to execute a block of code if the condition in the `if` statement is false.
- `for` loop: Used to execute a block of code a specified number of times.
- `while` loop: Used to execute a block of code as long as a condition is true.

## 6. Functions

Functions are reusable blocks of code that perform a specific task. To define a function in JavaScript, you can use the `function` keyword. Here is an example:

```javascript
function greet(name) {
  return "Hello, " + name + "!";
}

console.log(greet("Alice")); // Output: Hello, Alice!
```

## 7. Conclusion

In this lecture, we covered the basics of JavaScript, including its history, syntax, variables, data types, operators, control structures, and functions. These foundational concepts will help you get started with JavaScript programming and prepare you for more advanced topics in future lectures.
