# Exercise 1: JavaScript Variables

Welcome to the first exercise of the JavaScript Learning Course! In this exercise, you will practice working with JavaScript variables.

## Instructions

1. Declare a variable named `myNumber` and assign it the value `10`.
2. Declare a variable named `myString` and assign it the value `"Hello, world!"`.
3. Declare a constant named `myConstant` and assign it the value `3.14`.
4. Print the values of `myNumber`, `myString`, and `myConstant` to the console.
5. Change the value of `myNumber` to `20` and print the new value to the console.
6. Try to change the value of `myConstant` and observe what happens.

## Example

Here is an example of how to complete the exercise:

```javascript
// Step 1
var myNumber = 10;

// Step 2
let myString = "Hello, world!";

// Step 3
const myConstant = 3.14;

// Step 4
console.log(myNumber); // Output: 10
console.log(myString); // Output: Hello, world!
console.log(myConstant); // Output: 3.14

// Step 5
myNumber = 20;
console.log(myNumber); // Output: 20

// Step 6
// Uncomment the following line to see what happens
// myConstant = 2.71; // This will cause an error because constants cannot be reassigned
```

## Conclusion

In this exercise, you practiced working with JavaScript variables, including declaring variables, assigning values, and printing values to the console. You also learned about the difference between variables declared with `var`, `let`, and `const`.
